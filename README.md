# Predicting Poetic Movements

After scraping [Poetry Foundation](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/) for poems within certain genres, I perform natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the characteristics and word usage of four self-determined poetic movements: pre-1900 (Victorian and Romantic), Modern (a standalone category), Metropolitan (New York School [1st and 2nd Generation], Confessional, Beat, Harlem Renaissance, Black Arts Movement), and Avant-Garde (Imagist, Black Mountain, Language Poetry, Objectivist). Through text processing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis, I discover insights into how important words and structure relate to genre. I then create predictive models to provide further insight and confirm my findings during EDA. Finally, using Gensim's Doc2Vec, I created a [poetry recommendation system](https://evening-cove-11137.herokuapp.com/), which includes a lot of my engineered features in an optional filter.

## Findings and future considerations
- Pre-1900 poetry is easily recognized.
    - High number of end rhymes, most words per line, and simpler words (fewer syllables per word).
- Avant-garde is the polar opposite.
    - Practically no end rhymes, fewest words per line, and more complex words (more syllables per word).
- Poetry is rarely neutral (and generally positive) and fairly equally subjective/objective.
- Lots of visual and temporal vocabulary.
- Form/structure is important for prediction (especially Random Forest models).
    - Further exploration desired:
        - Other types of rhyme
        - Use of line breaks, tabs, and spacing
        - Topic modeling
- SVM relies mostly on vocabulary.
    - Further exploration desired:
        - Word embeddings (self-trained and pre-trained)
        - POS tagging

- Some of the words that the SVM model weighed the heaviest were surprising, given that they were mostly not among the top words overall:
    - crazy
    - among
    - nobody
    - form
    - look
    - dream
    - small
    - cry
    - star

## 10 most common words after removing stopwords (# of appearances):
    'love'  (2,996)
    'say'   (2,528)
    'day'   (2,345)
    'see'   (2,275)
    'make'  (2,260)
    'eye'   (2,091)
    'know'  (2,013)
    'night' (1,977)
    'life'  (1,975)
    'man'   (1,911)

# Conclusion
Creating and analyzing numerical features of poetic form and structure proved fruitful for most models in terms of classifying which movement a poem belonged to. They were not very helpful, however, for the best model, which used SVM. This model seemed mostly to use lower frequency words. With more time, I would like to explore training word embeddings and using pre-trained word embeddings with LSTM and CNN neural networks. My next steps include building a recommendation system using these results, as well as generating some poetry based on each movement. To make a truly good recommendation system, however, one would need to be able to build a model around specific genres, rather than an umbrella genre. Still, one may be able to use these umbrella genres as a top layer, then move within that to take a closer look at the individual genres it contains.
